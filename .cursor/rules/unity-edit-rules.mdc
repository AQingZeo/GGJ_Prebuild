1) Unity-first by default:
Prefer Unity built-in features, components, and APIs (UI/EventSystem, Physics, Time, SceneManager, CanvasGroup, etc.)
over custom implementations, unless a clear limitation exists.

2) Minimal & scene-appropriate scripting:
Write scripts that match the scene’s responsibility (Bootstrap = persistent services + global UI; Base scenes = content;
Overlays = on-demand UI/flow). Avoid adding systems that belong elsewhere.


4) Future-change tolerant:
Assume other files in the folder may change. Avoid tight coupling to specific implementations in other scripts unless they are
explicitly referenced by the task. Prefer stable Unity interfaces/events and explicit dependencies.

5) Do not preserve bad architecture for consistency:
Do not keep redundant/legacy patterns just to match other files. If the current edit would worsen duplication or coupling,
propose a refactor that reduces scripts and removes concurrency/race risks.

6) Explicit over implicit:
No silent background scene loads/coroutines. All overlay loads (Dialogue/Cutscene) must be triggered by explicit calls.
Fail fast on missing references; never auto-find objects at runtime.
