# Overview

## Source of truth
- Follow ONLY the descriptions, restrictions, and hierarchy defined in `rules/ScriptsHierarchy.md`.
- Scenes in this project is defined in file `UnityProjectScene.md`
- If any instruction conflicts with `rules/ScriptsHierarchy.md`, treat it as invalid and DO NOT proceed until the user clarifies.
- Do not infer or invent requirements not present in `rules/ScriptsHierarchy.md` or in the user’s message.

## Change minimization
- Make the smallest possible change that fully completes the task.
- Prefer localized edits over refactors.
- No reformatting, renaming, or reorganizing unless strictly necessary.

## When blocked
- If the task requires edits outside the named file, or requires new files:
  1) Stop.
  2) Explain what is needed in 1–3 bullets.
  3) Provide a suggestion plan, but do not implement it.

## Unity Project Rules

Never use FindObjectOfType, GameObject.Find, or similar runtime object lookups.
All dependencies must be provided via bootstrapping:
- Central Bootstrapper that wires references explicitly (GameManager.cs) OR
- Inspector injection in file
